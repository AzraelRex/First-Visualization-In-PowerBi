# First-Visualization-In-PowerBi
This is my first visualization in PowerBi about the stores and foods that you should buy during a apocalypse according to price data.


Costco is the best store to buy food from during an apocalypse because of it's cheap prices. The cheapest food to buy there is canned vegetables according to the data.
